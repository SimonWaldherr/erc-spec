# User guide: ERC template

If you want to create an ERC for your research already at the beginning, and not "post-hoc" after your research is complete, these templates can hopefully help.
They are divided into specific domains to be more concrete.

## Geoscience research in R

**Files in this template**

- `document.md` use RMarkdown, this is the main document
- `erc.yml` is template for the ERC configuration file with placeholders for all required fields
- `Dockerfile` is a template Dockerfile with some commands you can re-use to make sure all packages and tools that you need are installed

### Header template

The yaml header of the `document.md` file is the right place to enter your meta information right away from the start: Fill out the metadata fields, included in the template, as early in your personal workflow as possible and keep them up-to-date to prepare for the ERC creation progress. The metadata extractor of the o2r service will collect and prefer information from RMarkdown document headers.
